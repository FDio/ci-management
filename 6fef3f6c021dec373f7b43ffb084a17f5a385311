      "message": "\u003e Can you do the trigger change without editing the job name? I prefer to keep history unless I am sure nobody looks at it.\n\nThis was easy for the vpp-debug-* job, but it took a bit of education to figure out how to do it for vpp-csit-verify-device-master-1n-tx2 job.  Turned out to be quite elegant to use the \u0027Item Id\u0027 feature [0] to map the job definition to a separate job template.\n\n\u003e Ideally we would also include a manual trigger, for people trying to fix the failures by editing VPP code.\n\nDone.  Is there any way to test manual gerrit triggers prior to merging the patch?\n\n[0] https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/definition.html#item-id-s",
