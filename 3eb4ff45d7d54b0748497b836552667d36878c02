Definitely better than flipping +e...\n\n\u003e Even better would be to put the whole command into the \"if\" condition.\nI find this to be the least readable option.\n\n\u003e Finally, \" || echo $image_tags\" would create a one-liner.\nThis is the cleanest, but to my eyes the handling of the failure case gets lost amongst the sea of pipes \u0027|\u0027 whereas leaving the if statement emphasizes it.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Not sure which one is the most readable.\n\nSo I think option 1 by itself is most readable.",
