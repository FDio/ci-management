      "message": "Thanks.\n\nAfter some searching I have found that this is actualy fault of JJB, using exclamation mark (line 118) as an ordinary character, not as specifier for local tag. See [0].\n\nI have tried to search for a bugreport on JJB, but [1] does not interact with me.\n\nLooking at other CI project repos, I believe they solve the issue by bundling each file into one line:\n\n    - shell: !include-raw-escape: include-raw-rpm_dpdk-pkg-build.sh\n\nIf that creates long lines, it is because the \"include-raw-\" part of the filename is totally uninformative and should be dropped.\n\n[0] https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/issues/49\n[1] https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/723",
