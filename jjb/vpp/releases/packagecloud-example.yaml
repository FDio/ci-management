# Self-serve release jobs allow project committers to promote a jar file,
# container image, Python package or PackageCloud artifact from a staging area
# to a release area. A release yaml file controls the process, and Jenkins
# promotes the artifact when a project committer merges the release yaml file
# in Gerrit.
# PackageCloud Release Files documentation can be found in the RelEng Docs
