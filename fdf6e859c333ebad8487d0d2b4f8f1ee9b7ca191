      "message": "It makes the location of the fields within the job names consistent, which for me makes it easier to find a specific job in Jenkins.  \n\nThe explicit use of the executor architecture also means that I don\u0027t have to remember what architecture nomad server the job may be running on. This is also helpful when reverse mapping running nomad allocations to jenkins jobs.\n\nI think it will also help a newbie to the CI infra to understand where jobs may be allocated.",
