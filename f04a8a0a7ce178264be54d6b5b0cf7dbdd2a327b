(Last time it was an unused function, removed in one change and started to be used in the other.)\nBut I have hard time imagining such a breakage not being detected by the remaining scripts. Maybe something related to API CRCs?\n\nAnyway, I think the risk is low, just remember to re-add the checkstyle after fixing Ubuntu-20.04.",
