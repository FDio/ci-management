Remember, when global-jjb submodule is updated,
ci-management-jjb-merge job uses the previous configuration
(including scripts from the old submodule) when updating itself.
To make sure the new configuration is stable,
single "remerge" is recommended for any global-jjb commit bump.
This may even fix jobs if the first merge run failed after configuring jobs.
